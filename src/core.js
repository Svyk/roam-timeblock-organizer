/* timeblock-organizer v1.1.8
 *
 * v1.1.8 — Continuous, low-overhead organization. TimeBlock parent tags are
 *   matched as standalone tokens anywhere in the parent string, so the live
 *   `Schedule #TimeBlock` convention works. Watched pages now get a second,
 *   shallow watch on the TimeBlock itself; structural changes are reconciled
 *   after a short debounce while description-only typing is ignored. Open
 *   Elapsed Time sessions stay in a stable "Now" lane above the launcher and
 *   sort chronologically only after they close. Reordering uses Roam's
 *   one-write `block.reorderBlocks` API when available, with a minimal-move
 *   fallback. Watches are bounded to today, tomorrow, and one open historical
 *   page, reconciles are single-flight, and self-write suppression is per-page.
 *
 * v1.1.6 — Expanded conflict-ignore tag list. The original v1.1.4 `#concurrent`
 *   marker was a single-tag opt-out, but real overlaps include several
 *   non-conflicting categories that all deserve the same treatment:
 *     - Calendar / agenda-anchor events that already account for parallel work
 *       (you tag them `#calendar` so the planner sees them, but they shouldn't
 *       flag conflicts with real focus blocks)
 *     - All-day events (`#allday` / `#all-day`) — they span the whole day by
 *       definition and conflicting with them is meaningless
 *     - Early-out / leaving-early markers (`#leaving-early` / `#early-out`) —
 *       they're flags on the schedule, not conflicting time blocks
 *   New setting `conflictIgnoreMarkers` is a comma-separated list with sensible
 *   defaults. If EITHER block in an overlapping pair contains ANY of the
 *   listed tags (including the existing `concurrentMarker`), the pair is
 *   skipped in `detectOverlaps`. The existing `concurrentMarker` setting still
 *   works (its single value is merged into the ignore list on every reconcile),
 *   so no settings-page migration is needed for v1.1.5 users.
 *
 * v1.1.5 — Hotfix: TimeBlock parent detection broken by Nautilus retirement
 *   (Roam block ((bw1QibZxU)) on 2026-05-07). The default `timeblockSignature`
 *   was the legacy Nautilus render prefix
 *   (`"#TimeBlock {{[[roam/render]]:((roam-render-Nautilus-cljs))"`). After the
 *   render component was retired, daily-page TimeBlock parents became plain
 *   `#TimeBlock` blocks, which no longer matched the prefix → `findTimeBlockUid`
 *   returned null → reconcile silently no-op'd, leaving entries unsorted.
 *   Fix: `timeblockSignature` is now a TAG (`#TimeBlock` default), and
 *   `findTimeBlockUid` matches `^<tag>(\s|$)` — accepts both legacy form
 *   (with the render text after a space) AND the new plain form. Excludes
 *   accidental matches like `#TimeBlocked`. Existing user settings on
 *   [[TimeBlock Organizer Settings]] with the old long-prefix value need
 *   to be edited to just `#TimeBlock` for the matcher to pick up the new
 *   regex form (the user's settings-page value still wins over DEFAULTS).
 *
 * v1.1.4 — Three improvements driven by 2026-05-06 use:
 *   (a) `#concurrent` opt-out for intentional overlaps. The Phase 2 conflict
 *       detector flagged every overlapping pair, but sometimes Svyat is
 *       working on two things at once (long meeting + flexible Plodding
 *       task running in parallel) and the `**TimeBlock Conflicts**` status
 *       block is just noise. New `concurrentMarker` setting (default
 *       `#concurrent`) — if EITHER block in an overlapping pair contains
 *       the marker, the pair is skipped in `detectOverlaps`. The
 *       `#pinned-time` mechanism (which only blocks auto-bumping) is
 *       unchanged — `#concurrent` is a separate, narrower opt-out that
 *       suppresses the warning entirely.
 *   (b) Loose-sort fallback for incomplete time entries. The strict
 *       parseTimePrefix has three regexes (range, TODO-prefixed, single
 *       timestamp), all requiring `\s+(?=\S)` after the time — so entries
 *       like bare `19:00 ` (just the time, no description yet) or
 *       `{{[[TODO]]}} 19:00 thing` (time mid-text after a tool marker)
 *       fall through to "untimed" and historically got parked at the top
 *       of the TimeBlock as `tbOther`. New `looseParseTimePrefix` scans
 *       the first 30 chars for any HH:MM and returns it as a sort hint
 *       only — never used to rewrite the block. Default ON via
 *       `looseSortFallback`. Entries that even loose-parsing can't time
 *       still bucket to "untimed".
 *   (c) Untimed entries park at BOTTOM, not top. Before v1.1.4 anything
 *       that didn't parse as time-prefixed was placed at the start of the
 *       TimeBlock (the design intent was "park unsorted stuff visible at
 *       the top"), but practically it pushed every real time-entry down a
 *       row and made the day's chronology start at item 2+. Default
 *       `untimedAtBottom: true` flips it: incomplete drafts drift to the
 *       end where they're easy to finish, real entries lead the timeline.
 *       Set `untimedAtBottom:: false` on the settings page to restore the
 *       legacy ordering.
 *
 * v1.1.3 — Two parser fixes that left entries stuck out of order at the
 *   top of TimeBlock children, surfaced by a 2026-05-02 reconcile of
 *   ((oNbgd_kU2)):
 *   (a) `eh > 23` rejection of 24:00 end times. `23:30 - 24:00 EOD wrap`
 *       failed parseTimePrefix, got bucketed as tbOther, parked at the top
 *       of the sorted output. 24:00 is canonical end-of-day (1440 min) and
 *       should be valid as an END time (not a start). Now allows eh=24
 *       only when em=0; eh > 24 or 24:01+ stays invalid.
 *   (b) Single-timestamp entries (no range) like `20:51 {{⇥🕞:SmartBlock:
 *       Elapsed time}} ...` from SmartBlock click-loggers were treated as
 *       tbOther and parked at the top. Added SINGLE_TIME_PREFIX_RE as the
 *       third parse fallback. Treated as zero-duration points: sort by
 *       start time, never overlap (filter on endMin > startMin in
 *       detectOverlaps), never auto-bumped (rewriteTimePrefix doesn't
 *       handle the single shape — leaves them where the user put them).
 *
 * v1.1.2 — Chief of Staff compatibility. COS's `roam_create_todo` tool
 *   prepends `{{[[TODO]]}} ` to whatever text the agent passes, so a COS-
 *   scheduled item ends up shaped `{{[[TODO]]}} HH:MM - HH:MM description`
 *   — TODO marker FIRST, time range SECOND. v1.1.1's regex required the
 *   time range to be at position 0 of the string, so COS items got treated
 *   as `tbOther` and never sorted. Added TODO_TIME_PREFIX_RE that catches
 *   the marker-first shape. parseTimePrefix tries canonical first, falls
 *   back to tool-prefixed. rewriteTimePrefix preserves whichever shape was
 *   used (won't rewrite COS output to canonical — that'd surprise the user).
 *   Now reconciles + sorts ANY writer's output: COS, Better Tasks dropdowns,
 *   manual edits, future skills.
 *
 * v1.1.1 — Bugfix: relaxed TIME_PREFIX_RE so it matches all five canonical
 *   TimeBlock entry formats, not just inline-TODO entries. The prior regex
 *   required `HH:MM - HH:MM ` followed IMMEDIATELY by `{{[[TODO]]}}`, which
 *   excluded:
 *     - block-ref entries: `HH:MM - HH:MM ((uid))`
 *     - markdown-link wrapped block refs: `HH:MM - HH:MM [text](((uid)))`
 *     - meeting/event entries: `HH:MM - HH:MM **call with X**`
 *     - any plain-text time-prefixed line
 *   Fix: regex now matches `HH:MM - HH:MM ` followed by any content (positive
 *   lookahead `(?=\S)`). Bare `HH:MM - HH:MM` alone with no description still
 *   doesn't match (intentional — incomplete entry). rewriteTimePrefix
 *   simplified to a literal string replacement; no longer rebuilds TODO/DONE
 *   markers from scratch (they live AFTER the prefix and survive verbatim).
 *   Repro that prompted the fix: ((HU-11_ihG)) — `23:00 - 23:45 [{{[[TODO]]}}
 *   ...](((OImadoY9X))) #important` was sitting mid-stack in TimeBlock when
 *   it should've sorted to position N-1 (just before the SmartBlock button).
 *
 * v1.1.0 — Phase 2 + Phase 3 ship.
 *   Phase 2 (conflict detection): after each reconcile, scan the sorted
 *   TimeBlock children for overlapping time ranges. If conflicts exist,
 *   write a `**TimeBlock Conflicts** (N) #timeblock-status` block as the
 *   LAST child of the daily page with one bullet per overlapping pair
 *   (e.g. `09:00-10:00 "EMP review" overlaps 09:30-10:30 "swab walk" —
 *   30min`). Block is auto-deleted when zero conflicts remain. Always-on
 *   console warning regardless of status-block setting.
 *   Phase 3 (auto-resolve, opt-in): when `auto_resolve_conflicts` is on
 *   and `conflict_strategy` is `bump_forward`, the script rewrites the
 *   later item's time prefix to start at the earlier item's end, cascading
 *   forward. Refuses (and reports as a dead-end in the status block) if
 *   the cascade pushes past `cascade_cutoff_time` (default 23:00). Items
 *   tagged with `#pinned-time` are skipped (you decided their time
 *   intentionally; we won't move them).
 *
 * v1.0.0 — Phase 1: watches daily pages and reorganizes time-prefixed
 *   TODOs into the #TimeBlock parent, sorted by start-time. Pins the
 *   SmartBlock timestamp button as last child. Pull-watches today +
 *   tomorrow + historically-visited daily pages within a window. LRU-
 *   capped, debounced, idempotent.
 *
 * Bug it solves: when COS (or any tool) writes a `14:00 - 15:00 {{[[TODO]]}}
 * foo` block to today's daily page as a direct page-level child, this
 * plugin's pull-watch fires, the block gets moved under TimeBlock at the
 * right time-sorted position, the SmartBlock button stays pinned at the
 * end, and (v1.1.0) any time conflicts get reported / auto-resolved.
 *
 * No LLM call. Pure Roam datalog + block.move/update. Cost: $0.
